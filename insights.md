#  Business Insights — Customer Cohort & Retention Analytics

##  Pareto (80/20) and VIP customers
The analysis showed that approximately 20% of customers generate the majority of the company’s revenue.

**Interpretation:**
- VIP customers are critical for financial stability
- Losing even a small number of these customers can significantly impact revenue

**Business Actions:**
- Personalized offers for VIP customers
- Dedicated retention campaigns
- Prioritized support for high-value customers


##  Behavioral Segmentation
The majority of customers are concentrated in the `inactive` and `one_time` segments,
while the primary revenue is generated by `repeat` customers.

**Conclusion:**
- Acquiring new customers is less efficient than retaining existing ones
- Activating one-time customers represents a key growth opportunity


##  Churn Analysis
Churn is most common among customers with low CLV,
however, churn among VIP customers has a disproportionately large financial impact.

**Business Actions:**
- Early detection of churn signals
- Strong focus on churn prevention within high-value segments


##  Retention (Cohort Analysis)
Cohort analysis revealed:
- The highest churn occurs within the first 1–2 months
- Retention stabilizes among customers who pass the initial period

**Conclusion:**
- onboarding and early engagement are critically important
- Initial interactions significantly influence long-term customer value


##  Revenue Retention
A decrease in the number of customers does not always result in a proportional decline in revenue.
Active customers tend to increase their average order value over time.

**Conclusion:**
- Revenue retention is more important than customer count
- Focusing on CLV is strategically advantageous


##  Overall Conclusion
- Customer count ≠ revenue
- Business value is concentrated within a small segment of customers
- Retention is more effective than acquisition
- Cohort and CLV analysis are key tools for strategic decision-making
